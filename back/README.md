# Byteme's Churn Prediction Project

## Overview of '/back' folder
This folder contains the codes our backend team has worked on. The folder includes:
1) `churn_data.csv`: Our dataset used for analysis and model training. It is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset
2) `churncodee.py`: The Python codes used to train and compare between different models built using a variety of Machine Learning Algorithms and techniques. 
3) `model.py`: Python source code to train and save our final model for deployment.
4) `label_encoder.py`: Python source code to train our label encoders to transform our country and gender columns.
5) `final_model.pkl`: Our final model stored in a pickle file.
6) `country_encoder.pkl`: Our trained label encoder for 'country' column in our data, stored in a pickle file.
7) `gender_encoder.pkl`: Our trained label encoder for 'gender' column in our data, stored in a pickle file.
8) `test.csv`: A sample test dataset with the required columns. Use this to test our Data Upload functionality in the application.
